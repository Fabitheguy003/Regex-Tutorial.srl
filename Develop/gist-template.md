## Regex Components


* Anchors: ^ and $ match the start and end of a line respectively.

* Quantifiers: *, +, ?, {n}, {n,}, and {n,m} specify the number of times a character or group of characters should occur.

* OR operator: | matches either one expression or another.

* Character classes: [] match a single character from a group of characters.

* Flags: g, i, m, u, and y modify the behavior of the regex.

* Grouping and capturing: () group subpatterns together and extract specific parts of the match.

* Bracket expressions: [] match any character within a specified range or set.

* Greedy and lazy match: *, +, and ? can be made lazy by adding ?.

* Boundaries: \b and \B match specific positions that are not characters.

* Back-references: \n refer to a previously matched group in the regex.

* Look-ahead and look-behind: (?=...), (?!...), (?<=...), and (?<!...) match patterns only if they are followed or preceded by another pattern without including the pattern in the match.
